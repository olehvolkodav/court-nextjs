            Thanks for using MyCourtClerk! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our websites, software, and services (“Services”).
            For more information and details, please see our Frequently Asked Questions page.
          </p>

          <p>
            What & Why
          </p>

          <p>
            We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.
            Account information.
            We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).
            Your Stuff.
            Our Services are designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (“Your Stuff”), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it.
            This related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Contacts</i>. You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you, and your MyCourtClerk team (collectively, “MyCourtClerk Team”), if you&apos;re a MyCourtClerk Team user, to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do, we&apos;ll store those contacts on our servers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Usage information</i>. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders).
            We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and protect MyCourtClerk users. Please refer to our FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Device information. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services.
            This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your
          </p>

          <p>
            devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.
            Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.
            For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information.
            You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
            We may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote MyCourtClerk services.
            You can learn more about how cookies and similar technologies work, as well as how to opt out of the use of them for advertising purposes, here.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Marketing</i>. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge.
            These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services.
            If you register for our Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time.
            If you don&apos;t want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the unsubscribe link in the corresponding emails, or update your preferences in the Notifications section of your personal account.
            We sometimes contact people who don&apos;t have a MyCourtClerk account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before reaching out.
            If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by MyCourtClerk, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Bases for processing your data</i>. We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent. For more information on the lawful bases for processing your data, please see our FAQ.
            For more details on the categories of personal information that are included in the information above, please see our FAQ.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Other users</i>. Our Services are designed to help you collaborate with others. If you register your MyCourtClerk account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, join a MyCourtClerk Team, or collaborate with other MyCourtClerk users, we may suggest you or your team as a potential collaborator to other users or teams. For example, if you interact with a person at a company, and that person frequently works with one of their coworkers, we may suggest you as a potential collaborator for that coworker.
            Collaborators and potential collaborators may see some of your basic information, like your name, MyCourtClerk Team name, profile picture, device, email address, and usage information.
            This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Law & Order and the Public Interest. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of MyCourtClerk or our users; (d) protect MyCourtClerk&apos;s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it&apos;s stored on our Services or on your home computer&apos;s hard drive.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Security</i>. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>User Controls</i>. You can access, amend, download, and delete your personal information by logging into your MyCourtClerk account and going to your account settings page.

          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Retention</i>. When you sign up for an account with us, we&apos;ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account exists or as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we&apos;ll initiate deletion of this information after 30 days. Learn more here.
            But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Around the world</i>. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process, and transmit data in the United States and locations around the world—including those outside your country. Data may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.

          <p>
            MyCourtClerk does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as a legal basis for transfers of personal data.
